# Getting Started

For many developers, working with code is second nature, while wrestling with drag-and-drop interfaces like Canva or PowerPoint can feel like a headache. **Slide-CN** is built on the philosophy that creating presentations should be as powerful and flexible as building an application.

By using code to build your slides, you unlock a level of control and consistency that traditional tools simply can't match.

## Why Code?

### Consistency & Design System
With Slide-CN, typography and layout are built-in. You can create and reuse components across your deck, ensuring that every slide looks consistent without manually tweaking every text box.

### The Power of the Ecosystem
You have the full React and Open Source ecosystem at your fingertips. Need a chart? Import a charting library. Need a 3D model? Use Three.js. Your slides aren't just static images; they are a real application.

### Better Workflow
- **Version Control**: Manage your slides with Git. Track changes, collaborate with pull requests, and roll back if needed.
- **LLM Friendly**: LLMs are great at generating code. They can help you scaffold your presentation structure or generate content much better than they can manipulate a GUI.
- **Easy Sharing**: Host your deck as a website. Share it with a simple link. No more large file attachments or "missing font" errors.

### Interactive & Dynamic
Your presentation can be alive. Integrate live demos, fetch real-time data during your talk, or make the content interactive for your audience. You can even adapt the presentation content dynamically based on who is viewing it.

Slide-CN gives you the best of both worlds: the visual impact of a professional deck with the power and workflow of a modern web application.
