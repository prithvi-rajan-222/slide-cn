# Getting Started

For many developers, working with code is second nature, while wrestling with drag-and-drop interfaces like Canva or PowerPoint can feel like a headache. **Slide-CN** is built on the philosophy that creating presentations should be as powerful and flexible as building an application.

By using code to build your slides, you unlock a level of control and consistency that traditional tools simply can't match.

## Why Code?

### Consistency & Design System
Slide-CN is built on top of Shadcn. It is designed to look beautiful out of the box. Moreover, since everything is styled with code, you can be assured that spacing, fonts, and color will follow a consistent theme across slides.

With the Shadcn theming system, it is very easy to give your presentations a unique style. For example, [Tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/) has a ton of themes ready to use in your presentation.

### The Power of the Ecosystem
You have the full React and Open Source ecosystem at your fingertips. Need a chart? Import a charting library. Need a 3D model? Use [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). You want a nice background? Use [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev/). You are no longer limited by what Canva/PPT allows.

### Better Workflow
- **Version Control**: Manage your slides with Git. Track changes, collaborate with pull requests, and roll back if needed.
- **LLM Friendly**: LLMs are great at generating code. They can help you scaffold your presentation structure or generate content much better than they can manipulate a GUI.
- **Easy Sharing**: Host your deck as a website. Share it with a simple link. No more large file attachments or "missing font" errors.

### Interactive & Dynamic
Your presentation can be alive. Integrate live demos, fetch real-time data during your talk, or make the content interactive for your audience. You can even adapt the presentation content dynamically based on who is viewing it. Treating your presentations as a website instead of a static pdf opens a world of possibilities.

Slide-CN gives you the best of both worlds: the visual impact of a professional deck with the power and workflow of a modern web application.
