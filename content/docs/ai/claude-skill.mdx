title: Claude Code Skill
description: Add AI-assisted slide creation to your project with the slide-cn Claude Code skill.
---

## Overview

The slide-cn Claude Code skill gives [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) deep knowledge of the component API, layout patterns, and design conventions — so you can describe what you want in plain language and get production-quality slide code back.

Without the skill, Claude knows React and Tailwind but has to guess at slide-cn specifics. With it, Claude knows exactly which component to reach for, how to structure the inner wrappers, which color pairs to use for dark mode, and how to compose a full deck.

## Installation

Run this in your project directory:

<InstallCommand packageName="slide-cn-skill" />

This installs three files into `.claude/skills/slide-cn/` in your project:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Core rules — component usage, layout selection, inner wrapper patterns, typography |
| `references/components.md` | Full prop tables for every component |
| `references/patterns.md` | Complete TSX source for a product pitch deck and a technical deep-dive deck |

Claude Code automatically loads skills from `.claude/skills/` when they are relevant to the task.

## Usage

Once installed, just describe what you want:

> "Create a 5-slide pitch deck for a dev tool startup"

> "Add a slide with a code demo on the right and explanation on the left"

> "Replace the benefits slide with reveal cards"

Claude will apply the correct components, inner wrapper patterns, dark mode color pairs, and spacing rules — no guessing required.

You can also invoke the skill explicitly with the `/slide-cn` slash command in Claude Code.

## What the skill teaches Claude

**Layout selection** — which component to use for each slide type (title slides, two-column layouts, header + content grids, code demos).

**Inner wrapper patterns** — the exact `div` structure required around `TitleSlide` vs `HeaderWithContent` slides.

**Component API** — props, defaults, and sub-components for `Deck`, `Slide`, `TitleSlide`, `HorizontalSplit`, `HeaderWithContent`, `Reveal`, `CodeBlock`, `Callout`, `SlideImage`, and `SlideFooter`.

**Dark mode color pairs** — how to pair every Tailwind color with its dark variant so cards look right in both modes (e.g. `border-emerald-200 dark:border-emerald-900/50`).

**Card and reveal patterns** — the full icon + title + description card pattern, the 2×2 reveal grid, gradient backgrounds.

**File organization** — splitting each slide into its own component file inside a `slides/` directory.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed and running in your project
- slide-cn components already installed ([Installation guide](/docs/installation))
