description: The main component to create a slide deck
---

## Overview
This is the root component of your presentation. It controls which slide is shown. 

The Deck component handles everything from Keyboard navigations and swipe guestures, to animations and more.

The children of this component are the different slides of the presentation.

## Usage
```tsx
<Deck>
	<Slide key={0}>
		<FirstSlide />
	</Slide>
	<Slide key={1}>
		<SecondSlide />
	</Slide>
</Deck>
```

## Reference
### useDeck()
This hook allows you to control the slide navigation. For most use cases it is already taken care of, but if you want a fine grained way of going to the next/previous slide, or jumping to any slide, then you can use this hook.

You can use this as follows:
```tsx
const deck = useDeck();

function handleContactInfoClick() {
	deck.goTo(CONTACT_INFO_SLIDE);
}
```
