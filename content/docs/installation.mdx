---

The first thing you need to do is install [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).

After that, the main component to install is the [Deck](./components/deck) component. This is the minimum required code to get your presentations to work.


## Quick Start

You can install the default preset which includes all the recommended layouts and components by running the following command:

<InstallCommand packageName="slide-cn-default" />

## Compatibiility
Slide-CN works with any React + TypeScript project. It is framework agnostic and can be used with any framework that supports React.
